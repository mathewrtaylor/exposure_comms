Decided to do a little hunting and sure enough, there are plenty out there! If I wasn't surrounded by security minded people, this could very well be me; proud to share, but oblvious to the security concern. I designed this template to communicate with a repository owner and provide them some information they may be lacking, and hopefully help some people out!

## Usgae:
1.  Look to see the predominant language of the repository.
2.  Create an issue on the exposed repository with the subject "Exposure".
3.  Copy and paste the template in, and remove all sections that do not match the repository's main language (and keep GitHub's comments.
4.  Submit!
